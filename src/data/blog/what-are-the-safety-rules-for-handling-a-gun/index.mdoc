Mastering gun safety is critical for every firearm owner
As a responsible firearm owner, mastering gun safety is essential to ensure the safety of yourself and those around you. By following these four core rules, you can reduce risks and promote responsible handling of firearms:

Treat every gun as if it’s loaded.
Never point it at anything you don’t intend to shoot.
Keep your finger off the trigger until ready to fire.
Always know your target and what lies beyond it.
These principles are the foundation of gun safety and should be followed at all times when handling a firearm. Proper storage and transportation are also crucial aspects of gun safety. Guns should be stored unloaded in a locked safe and transported unloaded in a locked case to prevent accidents and unauthorized access.
